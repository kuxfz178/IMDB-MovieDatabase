# IMDb Movies Database Web App

A Flask web application that serves IMDb movie data with search functionality, personalized recommendations, and a user-friendly dashboard.

## Project Files

- `database_setup.py` - Creates SQLite database and loads movie data from TSV files
- `imdb_queries.py` - Database query functions and recommendation engine  
- `app.py` - Flask web server with API endpoints and web interface
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `imdb.db` - SQLite database file (created after setup)
- `data/title.basics.tsv` - IMDb movie dataset (required)

## Setup from Source

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- IMDb `title.basics.tsv` file placed in `data/` directory
- At least 1GB free disk space

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize Database
```bash
python database_setup.py
```
This will:
- Create SQLite database with movie schema
- Load and filter movie data (movies only, ~716K records)
- Create performance indexes
- Takes approximately 10-15 minutes

Expected output:
```
Setting up IMDb Movies database...
Tables created successfully!
Loading movie data...
Processed 100000 rows, found 72053 movies so far...
Database setup complete!
Movies loaded: 716,482
```

## Running the Web App

### Start the Server
```bash
python app.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8080`

## How to Interact

### 1. API Documentation Page
Visit `http://localhost:8080` to see:
- Database statistics
- Available API endpoints
- Interactive testing buttons

### 2. Interactive Dashboard  
Visit `http://localhost:8080/dashboard` for:
- **Movie Search**: Search by title or browse by genre

- **Already Watched**: Track movies you've seen with üëÅÔ∏è button
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get suggestions based on your want to watch list
- **Infinite Scroll**: Load more movies with "Load More" button
- **Current Movies Only**: Filters out movies released after 2025

### 3. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/movies/search?q=batman&limit=20&offset=0` - Search movies with pagination
- `GET /api/movies/genre/Action?limit=20&offset=0` - Filter by genre with pagination
- `GET /api/movies/year/2023` - Movies by year
- `GET /api/stats` - Database statistics
- `POST /api/recommendations` - Get personalized recommendations
- `GET /api/regex/search?pattern=^The.*&limit=20&offset=0` - Regex pattern search
- `GET /api/search/advanced?q=Action+Comedy&type=genre_pattern` - Advanced search
- `GET /api/views/recent_quality_movies` - Database views

**Note**: All search endpoints support `limit` (default 20) and `offset` (default 0) parameters for pagination.

## Usage Examples

### Search for Movies
1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Type movie name in search box
3. Click "Search" or press Enter

### Get Recommendations
1. Search and add movies to your want to watch list (click ‚ù§Ô∏è buttons)
2. Mark movies as watched (click üëÅÔ∏è buttons)  
3. Once you have at least 5 total interactions (want to watch + watched), click "Generate Recommendations"
4. System analyzes your preferences and suggests similar movies

### Track Your Viewing
- **Want to Watch**: Click ‚ù§Ô∏è to add movies to your watchlist
- **Mark as Watched**: Click üì∫ to track movies you've already seen
- **Visual Indicators**: Movies show different colors (green for want to watch, blue for watched, purple for both)

- **Year Patterns**: Use `199*` for 1990s movies

### View Statistics
- Visit main page for database overview
- Check `/api/stats` for detailed statistics

## Troubleshooting

**Database not found error**: Run `python database_setup.py` first

**Port 8080 in use**: Change port in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=9000)
```

**No movies found**: Verify `data/title.basics.tsv` file exists and is properly formatted

## Database Schema

**movies** table:
- `tconst` - IMDb identifier (Primary Key)
- `primaryTitle` - Movie title  
- `startYear` - Release year
- `runtimeMinutes` - Duration
- `genres` - Comma-separated genres
- `isAdult` - Content rating (0/1)

## System Requirements

- **Storage**: ~200MB for database, ~1GB for TSV processing
- **Memory**: ~500MB during setup, ~50MB during operation  
- **Setup Time**: 10-15 minutes for database initialization
- **Performance**: <200ms for most queries
